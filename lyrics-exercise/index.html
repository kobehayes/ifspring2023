    <h2>&apos;TEEN IDLE&apos;</h2>


    <div>
            
        <pre class="verse">
I wanna be a bottle blonde
I don't know why but I feel conned
I wanna be an idle teen
I wish I hadn't been so clean
I wanna stay inside all day
I want the world to go away
I want blood, guts, and chocolate cake
I wanna be a real fake
        </pre>

        <pre class="verse">
I wanna be a virgin pure
A 21st century whore
I want back my virginity
So I can feel infinity
I wanna drink until I ache
I wanna make a big mistake
I want blood, guts, and angel cake
I'm gonna puke it anyway
    </pre>

    <pre class="chorus">
Yeah, I wish I&apos;d been a
Wish I&apos;d been a teen, teen idle
Wish I&apos;d been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (Super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find I&apos;ve come alive
Come alive, I&apos;ve come alive
    </pre>

        <pre class="bridge">
I wish I wasn&apos;t such a narcissist
I wish I didn&apos;t really kiss the mirror when I&apos;m on my own
Oh God, I&apos;m gonna die alone
Adolescence didn't make sense
A little loss of innocence
The ugly years of being a fool
Ain&apos;t youth meant to be beautiful?
        </pre>
    
        <pre class="chorus">
Yeah, I wish I&apos;d been a
Wish I&apos;d been a teen, teen idle
Wish I&apos;d been a prom queen, fighting for the title
Instead of being sixteen and burning up a bible
Feeling super, super (Super!) suicidal
The wasted years, the wasted youth
The pretty lies, the ugly truth
And the day has come where I have died
Only to find I&apos;ve come alive
Only to find I&apos;ve come alive
Only to find I&apos;ve come alive
        </pre>
    </div>
